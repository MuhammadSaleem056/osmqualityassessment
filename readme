This reposotory is the collection of quality metrics that is develop to help humanitrian organisation in mapping priorties,
in order to this collection of OverPass queries are used and it can be visualise using either python or QGIS.


Steps to be followed in order to assess and visualise the quality of OpenStreetMap (OSM)
Step 1: Preparation
- You have to make sure you do your homework with literature study on what is the end-goal.
- For this repository Quality assessment is with respect to disaster managers in humanitarian crisis.
- Develop quality metric accordingly.
- User requirement is defined in the "User-requirement-quality-metircs" file in the directory.

Step 2: Get the data
- Using Overpass API key to get the required data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- Overpass API that are used is defined in the "Overpass-APIs" file in the directory

Step 3: Idea formation
- Most of the data that is extracted is in the form of polygons, multi-lines and lines (.geojson) and in-order to visualise it with respect to quality metric(s) it needs to be pre-processed.
- The quality metric-1 that is defined in "User-requirement-quality-metircs", which is the tag-completion and tag selection is done according to the user requirements. Idea behind it is visualise how much the tags are complete in certain part of the OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- Now, HOWs and WHATs are defined now we can just normalise with respect to total number of polygons that represent all the keys (e.g amenity = hospital) and total number of polygons that represent certain tag combination of that key. For example if we want to visualise the tag completion of the hospital with tag combination of emergency=* then we divide have to divide the number of polygons with tag combination of emergency=* to the number of polygons of just hospital key.

Step 4: Spatial analysis
